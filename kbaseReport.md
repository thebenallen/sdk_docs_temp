The [KBaseReport](https://appdev.kbase.us/#catalog/modules/KBaseReport) module allows the creation of KBase reports which can present text, HTML, and downloadable files to the user as output to your app. The KBaseReports module is the preferred way to communicate results to users.

*Why do you need a report?*
Reports in KBase allow a developer to present visualizations, generate human readable text strings, present warnings, contain output files that do not correspond to typed objects, and in general display information that is useful to a user without having to utilize kbase-ui widgets. 

*How many types of reports are there?*
Reports can be configured in a variety of ways, depending on how a developer sets up the parameters to parse and display the outputs of an App. 

*Where do I start with making a report?*
The first step in setting up KBase reports for an App is determining what the outputs of the program are in order to figure out how to best display results or give access to files to users. By understanding what kinds files, HTML reports, warnings, and other outputs are generated by the program outside of KBase, you can develop a strategy for adequately representing all these within the output cell for your App. The following parameters can be set to configure the output:
